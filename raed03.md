# HTML provides us with
# three different types:
●● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
●● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
●● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
## Ordered Lists
- <ol>
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.
- <li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
## Unordered Lists
- <ul>
The unordered list is created
with the <ul> element.
- <li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

## Limiting Width
### min-width, max-width
min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the
max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide.

## limiting hight 
In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.
The example on this page
demonstrates these properties
in action. It also shows you what
happens when the content of the
box takes up more space than
the size specified for the box.
If the box is not big enough to
hold the content, and the content
expands outside the box it can
look very messy. To control
what happens when there is not
enough space for the content of
a box, you can use the overflow
property
## Border, Ma rgin
## & Padding
- Border
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

- Margin
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

- Padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

## display
inline
This causes a block-level
element to act like an inline
element.
block
This causes an inline element to
act like a block-level element.
inline-block
This causes a block-level
element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.
none
This hides an element from the
page. In this case, the element
acts as though it is not on the
page at all (although a user could
still see the content of the box if
they used the view source option
in their browser).
## Box Shadows
## box-shadow
Horizontal offset
Negative values position the
shadow to the left of the box.
Vertical offset
Negative values position the
shadow to the top of the box.
Blur distance
If omitted, the shadow is a solid
line like a border.
Sp read of shad ow
If used, a positive value will
cause the shadow to expand in
all directions, and a negative
value will make it contract.

A Boolean variable can only have
a va lue of true or fa 1 se, but this
data type is very helpful.
In the example on the right, the
values true or fa 1 se are used
in the cl ass attributes of HTML
elements. These values trigger
different CSS class rules: true
shows a check, fa 1 se shows a
cross.
The logical AND is used to see
if the user's score is greater
than or equal to the pass mark
in both of the rounds of the test.
The result is stored in a variable
called passBoth.
Here you can see that an
if ... e 1 se statement al lows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false
A for loop is often used to loop
through the items in an array.

# Background Images
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

- repeat
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat
property isn't used).

repeat-x
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).
repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically
only.
no-repeat
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. It
can have one of two values:
fixed
The background image stays in
the same position on the page.
scroll
The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.

images on several pages of your site.

using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

repeated across the background of the box.

background position of an image.

load, you can create image sprites.

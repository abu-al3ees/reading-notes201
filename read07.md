# Basic Table Structure
<table>
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

<tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).


At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.


<td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)


<th>
The <th> element is used just
like the <td> element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row.
<thead>
The headings of the table should
sit inside the <thead> element.
<tbody>
The body should sit inside the
<tbody> element.
<tfoot>
The footer belongs inside the
<tfoot> element.

- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.


An object model is a group of objects, each of
which represent related things from the real world.
Together they form a model of something larger.


OBJECTS :
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.
IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.
The Document Object Model (DOM) :
specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE:
Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
CREATINGÂ· OBJECTS USING LITERAL NOTATION:
This example starts by creating an object using literal notation. This object is called hotel which represents a hotel called Quay with 40 rooms (25 of which have been booked).
CREATING MORE OBJECT LITERALS:
Here you can see another object. Again it is called hote 1, but this time the model represents a different hotel. For a moment, imagine that this is a different page of the same travel website.
Document object model
he Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

# Basic Table Structure
<table>
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
<tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.
<td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
<th>
The <th> element is used just
like the <td> element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row.
<thead>
The headings of the table should
sit inside the <thead> element.
<tbody>
The body should sit inside the
<tbody> element.
<tfoot>
The footer belongs inside the
<tfoot> element.

- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.


An object model is a group of objects, each of
which represent related things from the real world.
Together they form a model of something larger.

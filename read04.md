Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## mailto:
 email-links.html HTML
To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.
On the right you can see that
an email link looks just like any
other link but, when it is clicked
on, the user's email program
will open a new email message
and address it to the person
specified in the link.

## target
If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.
One of the most common
reasons a web page author
might want a link to be opened
in a new window is if it points to
another website. In such cases,
they hope the user will return
to the window containing their
site after finishing looking at the
other one.

- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
-  You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
-  You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we
introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)
Fixed Positioning
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.
Floating Elements
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.
## Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
 ## Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.
Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.

<div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
   information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more
  than one piece of related information.
  - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
    strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

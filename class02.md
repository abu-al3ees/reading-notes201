# Headings
- <h1>
- <h2>
- <h3>
- <h4>
- <h5>
- <h6>
HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
- <h1> is used for main headings
- <h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
- <h3> element is used, and so
on...
## Bold & Italic
### <b>
By enclosing words in the tags
<b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.

### <i>
By enclosing words in the tags
<i> and </i> we can make
characters appear italic.

## <sup>
The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such

## Line Breaks &
## Horizontal Rules
- <br/>
used for dowen new line 

- <hr />
To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the <hr /> tag.
## Strong & Emph asis
<strong>
The use of the <strong>
element indicates that its
content has strong importance.
For example, the words
contained in this element might
be said with strong emphasis.
By default, browsers will show
the contents of a <strong>
element in bold.

### <abbr>
 html HTML
If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the <abbr>
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.

### <cite> 
element can be used
to indicate where the citation is
from.
### <address>
 02/address.html HTML
The <address> element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.
### <ins>
### <del>
The <ins> element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while
the <del> element can show text
that has been deleted from it.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

## CSS Properties Affect
## How Elements Are
## is played
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

<link> external-css.html HTML
The <link> element can be used
in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS
file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does
not need a closing tag), and it
lives inside the <head> element.
It should use three attributes:1-href 2-type 3-rel
<style>
You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the
<head> element of the page.
The <style> element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/
css.
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

## DATA TYPES
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
- strings, 
- Booleans.
- NUMERIC DATA TYPE

## ARRAYS
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.
You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.
Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold.
If you don't know how many
items a list will contain, rather
than creating enough variables
for a long list (when you might
only use a small percentage
of them), using an array is
considered a better solution.
For example, an array can be
suited to storing the individual
items on a shopping list because
it is a list of related items.
Additionally, each time you write
a new shopping list, the number
of items on it may differ.
As you will see on the next page,
va lues in an array are separated
by commas.
In Chapter 12, you will see that
arrays can be very helpful when
representing complex data.

## VALUES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

## EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
